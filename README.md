# Hate-speech-detection-using-Word2vec-also-Finetuning
This includes 3 files:
1. hate speech word2vec (finetuning).ipynb - The primary objective was to finetune word2vec for text classification but due to the changes in gensim itself we wer'nt able to retrieve the finetuned model. so, we tried simple classification in next two notebooks on seperate datasets.
2. hatespeech data 1 word2vec.ipynb - on dataset1
3. hatespeech data 2 word2vec.ipynb - on dataset2 (Tried cleaner data than dataset 1 which imroved our results significantly)
